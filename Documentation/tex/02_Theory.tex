\section{Bias point and class of operation}
The bias point, or working point, of an amplifier determines which class the amplifier is operating within, which in turn tells us something about the amplifiers efficiency, linearity and quiescent current. There is a wide variety of classes, the most common being class A, AB, B and C. 
Class A amplifiers have the highest quiescent current, the best linearity and the lowest efficiency (maximum theoretical efficiency of 50\% ). 
Class B amplifiers have no quiescent current, maximum theoretical efficiency of 78\% , but will only conduct during the positive half of the signal cycle. Class AB is a hybrid between class A and B, sacrificing some of the efficiency of the class B amplifier, but gaining some of the linearity of the class A. 
Class C amplifiers are the most efficient of the four, having a maximum theoretical efficiency of almost 90\% . But they conduct for less than 50\%  of the signal cycle, typically they only conduct for a third of the cycle or less.
If the input signal does not exceed a certain level, one can bias the amplifier as an AB class, thus reducing quiescent current while still have class A operation in terms of linearity.

Once the amplifier class of operation has been determined, the bias point can be determined by examining the I-V characteristics of the transistor. By drawing a load line going from the drain-source voltage on the X axis, to the drain saturation current on the Y axis, we get a linear line crossing the different gate-source voltage curves. See figure~\ref{fig:fig_Load_line}. By choosing a bias point along this linear curve, we can predict both quiescent current and voltage. The bias point for a class A amplifier will approximately be at Vds/2.

\end{figure}

\section{Efficiency}
There are several ways of expressing amplifier efficiency, the most common in the RF community being power added efficiency (PAE). PAE takes into account both the DC to RF power conversion, as well as the RF power delivered into the input of the device.

\begin{equation}
	PAE=\frac{P_{RFout}-P_{RFin}}{P_{DC}}=\frac{P_{RFout}-P_{RFin}}{V_{DC} \times I_{DC}} 
\end{equation}

By subtracting the power of the input signal from the output power, we get a better indication of the actual DC to RF power conversion. For low gain amplifiers the input power can be substantial and using drain efficiency (which does not take input power into consideration), will in these cases give a falsely high efficiency.

\section{Linearity}

Linearity is an important factor to consider when designing an amplifier. A linear amplifier will amplify a small input signal and a large input signal by the same amount, meaning less distortioin of high power signals will be exhibited. To better see the linearity of a transistor one can plot the drain current as a function of the gate-source voltage. This will produce a characteristic plot which shows how linear the transistor is for certain regions of the input signal. The linearity of an amplifier is found by sweeping the input power and recording the corresponding output powers, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:Meas_Pout} in the appendix.

%	  \label{fig:fig_Linearity_line}
%\end{figure}

%We can see in figure~\ref{fig:fig_Linearity_line} the most linear area for this device approximately lie between $-2.8V$ and $-2.4V$. Biasing the transistor for $-2.6V$ would offer the most linear response as long as the amplitude of the input signal does not exceed $0.2V$ in the negative half period, which would drive the gate-source voltage below $-2.8$ volts and into cut-off. 

\section{S-parameters}

S-parameters, or scattering parameters, are a set of parameters which describe the reflection and transmission coefficients of each of the ports of a device. When referring to a two-port device such as an amplifier we use the parameters $S_{11},\, S_{12},\, S_{21}$ and $S_{22}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
	  \centering
	  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/S_parameter_image}
	  \caption{two-port signals for s-parameters}
	  \label{fig:fig_sparam_vis}
\end{figure}

 $S_{11}$ refers to the part of an incident wave in $a_1$, being reflected to the source through $b_1$, $S_{12}$ refers to the reverse voltage gain, $S_{21}$ refers to the forward voltage gain and $S_{22}$ refers to the part of an incident wave being fed into $a_2$ being reflected back towards $b_2$.
 The relationship between incident power, reflected power and the S-parameter matrix is given by the equation:
 \begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	b_1\\
	b_2
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	S_{11} & S_{12}\\
	S_{21} & S_{22}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\times
	\begin{bmatrix}
	a_1\\
	a_2
	\end{bmatrix}
 \end{equation}

\section{Stability}
Amplifier stability refers to the amplifiers tendency to oscillate, which is something we strive to prevent. Oscillations may occur when the reflected wave is larger than the incident wave.

\begin{figure}[H]
	  \centering
	  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Reflection_example}
	  \caption{reflections of an amplifiers circuit}
	  \label{fig:fig_reflection_ex}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:fig_reflection_ex} the $\Gamma$ values represent the reflection coefficients for each of the ports they are associated with. If the input and output matching networks are passive, then $|\Gamma_s|<1$ and $|\Gamma_L|<1$. The circuit can be unstable if $|\Gamma_{in}|>1$ and $|\Gamma_{out}|>1$. 

By expressing $|\Gamma_{in}|$ and $|\Gamma_{out}|$ as functions of $\Gamma_L$  and $\Gamma_s$ respectively, in combination with the S-parameters, we can find an expression for a circle in the smith chart which represents the border between the region of stability and instability at input and output. These are called stability circles, and can tell us at what impedances the device is stable, or unstable.

There are two main measures of stability, the K-factor and the $\mu$-factors. The K-factor tells us whether or not the amplifier is stable for a specific frequency, which means we need to evaluate the K-factor from 0Hz (DC) to the highest frequency the amplifier can oscillate at.

\begin{equation}
K=\frac{1-|S_{11}|^2-|S_{22}|^2+|\nabla |^2}{2\times |S_{21}\times S_{12}|},\, \nabla =S_{11}\times S_{22}-S_{12}\times S_{21}
\end{equation}

If $K>1$ the amplifier is stable for the specific frequency. If $K>1$ for all frequencies we say the amplifier is unconditionally stable, and if $K<1$ for only certain frequencies, we say the amplifier is conditionally stable.  The K-factor tells us if the amplifier is stable, but not by how much. A larger value of K does not indicate a more stable amplifier. When designing an amplifier it is useful to know how stable our device is, so we can take variations in the manufacturing process into consideration. For this purpose we use the $\mu$-factors:

\begin{gather}
	\mu=\frac{1-|S_{11}|^2}{|S_{22}-\delta \times S_{11}^*|+|S_{12}\times S_{21}|}>1 \\
	\mu_\text{prime}=\frac{1-|S_{22}|^2}{|S_{11}-\delta \times S_{22}^*|+|S_{12}\times S_{21}|}>1
\end{gather}

The $\mu$-factors tell us the distance from the center of the smith chart, to the edge of the stability circle. $\mu$ shows this distance for the output, while $mu_\text{prime}$ shows the same for the input. If the value of the factor is above 1 the device is unconditionally stable for the given frequency, and the larger the values of the factors are the more stable a device is. This way we can add some margin to our amplifier's stability, to ensure it will remain stable even with the possible variations of real components.

\section{Quarter-wave transformer}

When the wavelength of a signal is comparable to the circuit size, it is possible to manipulate the phase of the circuit's impedance by adjusting the length of the PCB traces. Adding a quarter wavelength of PCB traces equals to a $180^\circ$ impedance shift in the smith chart. Such a piece of trace is called a quarter-wave transformer, as it allows to convert an open end of a microstrip trace to a short circuit to ground and vice versa. Adding two quarter-wave transformers in series transforms back to the original impedance. % This allows us to create RLC circuits by simply manipulating the PCB trace geometry. A transmission line with a length equal to the signal wavelength will result in a $360^\circ$ phase-shift in the signal. Similarly a trace with a length equal to a quarter of the wavelength would result in a $90^\circ$ phase shift. If we have an open stub with a length equal to $^1/_4$ wavelength, the impedance at the open end of the stub would be infinite. The voltage at that point would be high, while the current would be zero. At the other end of the stub, the phase of the signal would have shifted  $90^\circ$, and the stub would appear to be a short circuit. This effect is highly frequency dependent, and the circuit can thusly be designed to only affect the signals of our choosing.

\section{Matching}

To affect stability, performance and efficiency matching networks are created at the amplifier input and output to adjust the impedance “seen” by the source and load. See figure~\ref{fig:fig_reflection_ex}. For maximum power transfer, the output and input matching networks are matched to the characteristic impedance of the source and load, usually $50\Omega$ for RF applications. For maximum gain or low noise the networks must be intentionally designed with mismatches compared to the characteristic impedances. By tweaking the networks matching, we can find a balance between the desired properties.

\section{Small signal vs large signal}

Small and large signal analysis is used to evaluate the amplifier design once a bias point has been chosen. When performing small signal analysis we use the chosen bias point, and look at the amplifiers response in the linear area of operation. Here we can assess the amplifiers gain, linearity and efficiency for signals well within the amplifiers capabilities. The output signal may then be described as:

\begin{equation}
v_{out}=a_0+a_1v_{in}
\end{equation}

When looking at large signal analysis on the other hand we use large input signals to drive the amplifier, and a non-linearity is introduced. This non-linearity may be described as:

\begin{equation}
	v_{out}=a_0+a_1v_{in}+a_2v_{in}^2+a_3v_{in}^3 \dots
	\label{eq:eq_non_linearity}
\end{equation}

With a cosine signal on the input, the amplifiers gain may be described as:

\begin{equation}
	G=a_1-\frac{3}{4}a_3|V_{in}|^2
\end{equation}

For a small $v_{in}$, it is shown that the gain is linear. But as $v_{in}$ increases, the higher order output are increased enough to make decrease the output by a considerable amount. Thus we can find the 1 dB compression point, this is the $v_{in}$ level at which the amplifiers gain is reduced by 1 dB because of the non-linearity. After this point, the gain will be decreased further.

\section{Intermodulation distortion}

Intermodulation distortion (IMD) is found when performing a two tone test on a non-linear device. Because of the same effects as shown in equation~\ref{eq:eq_non_linearity}, the amplifier would create different harmonics. Since $V_{in}$ consists of two signals of different frequencies, the output will consist of several summations and subtractions of the harmonics. See figure~\ref{fig:fig_distortion_vis} for an example.
