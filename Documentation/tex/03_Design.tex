\chapter{Method of design}
  In this chapter, the design procedure will be described, and the choices we made will be clarified. Then the test-measurements is explained in detail. During the design process, we will use the models given for inductors and capacitors. We will use ideal resistors from the libraries in ADS.
  \section{DC Bias point at gate}
    The first step in designing a power amplifier is to choose the DC bias point, which will define the amplifier’s class of operation.We will be aiming for a deep AB class design, because this gives a good compromise between gain, linearity and efficiency, which enables us to meet the required specifications as well as obtain good results with respect to the other performance parameters with no set requirements.
    We are using the ADS Design Guide called FET\_ IV\_ Gm\_ PowerCalcs, where we inserted the transistor as shown in figure. From the design guide we used the I/V-plot to find the gate bias voltage that gives the desired quiescent drain current of 300mA, which will be used as a starting point as this will be low in the class AB range $(0 < Ids < Imax/2)$. We may need to tweak the quiescent current when testing on the real amplifier. The gate bias voltage that gives this quiescent current was found  to be -2.6V.

  \end{figure}

  \section{Bias network}
  To ensure that the RF input does not affect the DC power supply, a quarter-wave transformer was used to present an infinite impedance in the 2.4GHz band when looking towards the DC power supplies from the RF signal pathways. The values were tuned to obtain optimal ac-block as seen from the transistor gate. In addition, a bank of lumped capacitors was used to suppress noise from the DC power supplies from entering the RF signal pathway. The same DC bias network was used for both the gate and drain DC bias voltage connections.

	\label{fig:fig_bias_net}
  \end{figure}
  
  \section{Stability}
  To check if the amplifier is stable, we used the small-signal S-parameter simulations in ADS with added blocks for measuring the stability factors (mu and muprime) on the input and output. According to the measurements, the amplifier is stable at higher frequencies, but at lower frequencies it is unstable. To remove the instabilities we will introduce losses at the lower frequencies, by adding a series RC element at the input, and a resistor at the DC bias feed point as shown in figure~\ref{fig:fig_stab_net}.
  \begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Stability_network}
	\caption{Stability-network}
	\label{fig:fig_stab_net}
  \end{figure}
  The capacitor C and Resistor R1 presents a high impedance for lower frequencies, but for higher the capacitor is an effective short. The resistor R2 is introduced as a loss for all frequencies.
  
  The values C,R1 and R2 were found by using ADS’ optimization feature, with optimization goals for the stability factors (mu and muprime) and the maximum available gain. The lowest value for the stability factors across the simulated frequency range from 0Hz to 6GHz was 1.05.

  \section{Matching}
  When stabilizing the amplifier, one of the goals for optimization was maximum available gain. to achieve this gain, one must match the input and output to 50 Ohm. To realise this without having to mount more components, we added an open-circuit stub of microstrip line as shown in figure~\ref{fig:fig_match_net}.
  \begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Matching_network}
	\caption{Setup for matching the amplifier with 50$\Omega$}
	\label{fig:fig_match_net}
  \end{figure}
  The setup was used both on the input and output of the amplifier, and optimized the values for max S21 within the band.
  
  \section{Large signal simulation, one tone input signal}
  To run large signal simulation, a design guide called HB1TonePAE\_ Pswp was used. In the design guide, we checked the power added efficiency, the interpolated output spectrum and fundamental output power. We saw that power added efficiency was low, so we ran an optimization with increased power added efficiency and output power with 27dBm input as goals.
  
  \section{Large signal simulation, two tone input signal}
  To run large signal simulation two tone, a design guide called HB2TonePAE\_ Pswp was used. In the design guide we checked the Power added efficiency, interpolated output spectrum and the output power with 27dBm as input. 
  \section{Layout and conversion to real components}
  Now that the design is complete, all components that are related to the layout will be added. This is done to make sure that the layout will fit within the predefined board size and that there is as few as possible steep transitions between different widths of microstrip line. At the same time, the transistor was placed in the center of the board with its borders to cut out from the PCB. With the restriction, the lines on the output was too long, added bends to make it fit.
  \section{Tests with complete layout}
  All the above simulations was done again since the changes done may change for instance the stability of the amplifier. All new simulations are done with the whole design. A few tweaks with respect to line geometry was needed to obtain similar responses but the design passed the requirements given by the task.
  \section{Laboratory measurements}
  The goal for the measurements is to determine if the amplifier (DUT) passes the requirements given by the task or not. To do this we need to perform a small signal gain test, one-tone large signal test and a two-tone large signal test.
  \subsection{Small-signal s-parameters}
	\begin{figure}[h]
	  \centering
	  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Small_signal_meas}
	  \caption{Small-signal measurements setup}
	  \label{fig:fig_small_meas}
    \end{figure}
	As shown in figure~\ref{fig:fig_small_meas}, there will be an attenuator connected to the output of the amplifier to protect the network analyzer ports from excessive input voltages that could damage the instrument. The network analyzer was calibrated using a TOLS (through-open-load-short) calibration sequence.
  
  \subsection{Large signal one- and two-tone}
    \begin{figure}[h]
	  \centering
	  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/Large_signal_meas}
	  \caption{Large-signal measurements setup}
	  \label{fig:fig_large_meas}
    \end{figure}
	We were at liberty to choose three set frequencies to perform the large-signal testing at. We chose the frequencies of 2.35 GHz, 2.40 GHz and 2.45 GHz, because testing at these frequencies would give us the best prerequisites for determining if we had met the requirement specifications within the band of operation. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:fig_large_meas} there are several items that will introduce losses in the signal pathway, all of those must be subtracted from the measured power levels when analyzing the results in Matlab.

  \subsection{Calculations}
  Table~\ref{tab:cree_sparm} lists the S-Parameters for the transistor as given in \cite{CreeDS}. Using these, we can calculate the $K$ and $\lvert \Delta \rvert$ factors to determine the stability using equations (6.31) and (6.32) in \cite{Pozar}.
  \begin{table}[h]
	  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
	  $S_1$$_1$ & $0.9 \angle 165^{\circ}$ & $S_{12}$ & $0.019 \angle -17.6^{\circ}$ \\
	  $S_{21}$ & $4.21 \angle 46.9^{\circ}$ & $S_{22}$ & $0.39 \angle -162^{\circ}$ \\
  \end{tabular}
	  \caption{S-parameters for Cree CGH40010}
	  \label{tab:cree_sparm}

  \end{table}

  Using these values we find $K = 0.732$ and $\lvert \Delta \rvert = 0.282$. \emph{Rollet's condition} specifies that an amplifier will be unconditionally stable if $K > 1$ and $\lvert \Delta \rvert < 1$. Since only the latter condition is fulfilled in our case, the transistor will not be unconditionally stable by itself.
