This report describes the process of designing, building and verifying an RF power amplifier for the 2.4 GHz$\pm$50MHz frequency band. The Cree CGH40010F GaN transistor is used as the active device. The circuit is built on standard FR-4 substrate. The circuit is designed and simulated in the Keysight ADS software suite, then built and measured using standard RF measurement instruments such as a network analyzer and spectrum analyzer.

The resulting amplifier was measured to have a small-signal gain of 14dB at the center frequency of 2.4 GHz, however, the gain diminished rapidly towards the lower end of the operating band at 2.35 GHz. Also the large-signal power gain and power added efficiency showed poorer performance at the lower end of the operating band. At 2.4 GHz, the large-signal gain with an input signal of 27dBm was measured to 10dB with a power-added efficiency of 35\% . Third-order intermodulation distortion was measured to -22dBc at a peak output power of 38dBm with a two-tone input signal with 5Mhz spacing.
